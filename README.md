SentinelOne STAR Rules

STAR custom detection rules, SOC teams can turn queries from Deep Visibility, SentinelOneâ€™s EDR data collection and querying mechanism, into automated hunting rules that trigger alerts and responses when rules detect matches. STAR also allows users an automated way to look at every endpoint event collected across their entire fleet and evaluate each of those events against a list of rules.
