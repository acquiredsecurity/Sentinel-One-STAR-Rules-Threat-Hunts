SentinelOne STAR Rules

STAR custom detection rules, SOC teams can turn queries from Deep Visibility, SentinelOneâ€™s EDR data collection and querying mechanism, into automated hunting rules that trigger alerts and responses when rules detect matches. STAR also allows users an automated way to look at every endpoint event collected across their entire fleet and evaluate each of those events against a list of rules.


These rules have been crafted from working thousands of Incident Reponse engagaments as well as from ongoing research. Sometimes this might not be the best way to detect things for you but it works for me. Always remeber to test queries before turning them into STAR rules.

** This is a work in progress later I will add mapping to Mitre techniques.
